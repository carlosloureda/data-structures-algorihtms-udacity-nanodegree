# Data Structures and Algorithms Udacity Nanodegree

This repository contains the projects code for the [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256) at Udacity. This is an awesome course to ace your technical coding interview.

I just uploaded the projects I did to prepare for being a mentor for this nanodegree to have at least some codes as some learning resources for the course.

The nanodegree contains 4 projects you need to complete, 1 project per learning block:

# Introduction

On this block of content we go over an introduction of the course, a Python Refresher lesson and some tecniques to solve problems and an introduction to calculate efficiency of problems.

The project is called **Unscrambe Computer Science Problems** and we go over 5 tasks over some text files. See the code [here](/project_1/README.md)

# Data Structures

Udacity guides us through all kinds of _data structures_, it contains: Arrays, LinkedLists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, HashMaps and more, and also we practice recursion problems.

The project is called **Show Me the Data Structures** and we have 6 different problems to solve. See the code [here](/project_2/README.md)

# Basic Algorithms

We go over both Basic Algorithms and the Sorting Algorithms:

    - Basic Algorithms: Binary Search, Tries, Heaps, Red-black trees
    - Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, HeapSort

The project is called **Problems vs. Algorithms** and we have 7 different problems to solve. See the code [here](/project_3/README.md)

# Advanced Algorithms

Here is where things get complicated, but thinking that these algorithms are a great introduction to the artificial intelligence problems.

We go over:

- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Dynamic Algorithms
- A\*

The project is called **Route Planner**. In this project, you will build a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map. The solution is [here](/project_4/README.md)
