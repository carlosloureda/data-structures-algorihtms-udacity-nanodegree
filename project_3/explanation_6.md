This problem focuses on **finding max and min values** from an unsorted array.

We are asked if we can solve the problem with a single traversal (O(n)) and just
using 2 placeholders for refercing the _min_ and _max_ values.

## Time complexity

In my solution, I perform a **single transverse** of the input (size n), being the time complexity of **O(n)**.

## Space complexity

We have just a pair of pointers. It is independent from _input size_; **O(1)**.
